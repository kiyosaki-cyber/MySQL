Problem statement: 

People rarely have a platform to set their financial and expenditure targets therefore end up spending their hard-earned money on things they did not intend to.

Solution:

People need to have a platform that they can set budget targets.

Objectives:

 1  An app that user can use to set their expenditure targets.

2  An app that users can view their targets regularly to remind     themselves of their targets.

3  An app that a user can sign up to and login to their account to ensure safety of their account data 

Expecations:
1 App that can authenticate each user and only allow them to access only their account data through sign up and login forms

2 App that user can set out their expenditure using a prebuilt form 

3 App that users can view their targets

4 App that users can navigate easily from one page to another.
